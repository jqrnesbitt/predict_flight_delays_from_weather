# Predict Flight Delays From Weather Data

This repo is for Team 30's final project submission for W261. Here we explore the effects of weather on various flight delays from 2015 to 2019. Within this report we do the following:

 - Perform a detailed exploratory data analysis on flights and weather data
 - Join the datasets
 - Perform feature selection
 - Create a custom machine learning pipeline
 - Train/Test models through a custom grid search and cross validation function
 - Validate on unseen data and produce results
